        <p>Federal Party SA (FPSA) is a vehicle all South Africans can use to solve the problems of
        South Africa. FPSA is the party for self-determination of all folks/groups, <em>but each folk/group
        needs leaders to represent them in FPSA. Leaders must come forward and make themselves available.</em>
        Votes for self-determination must come together in FPSA to effectively oppose the imperialist parties,
        which prioritise centralised governance. The following people are needed currently.
        </p>
        <h2>Fundraising</h2>
        <p>Please have a look at <a href="Fundraising.html" target="_blank">the
        fundraising page</a>, where the current possibilities are explained.
        Donations can be sourced. Also, a funding project is explained, whereby cryptocurrency investments,
        fund FPSA. South African citizens of all groups must fund FPSA. A high commission of 17% is payable by FPSA to
        fundraisers on funds raised.</p>
        

        <h2>Representing FPSA politically</h2>
        <p>FPSA needs local, provincial and national representatives everywhere in South Africa,
        from all folks/groups. Decentralised governance is prioritised with the focus on local leaders, each
        representing their specific culture, they comprehend well.</p>
        <h3>Local</h3>
        <p>"There are 278 municipalities in South Africa, comprising eight metropolitan, 44 district
        and 226 local municipalities."<sup><span style="font-size:small">1</span></sup> The different cultures of
        South Africa are in different regions. Multiculturalism is most prevalent in the metropoles. Local leaders,
        representing their culture in FPSA, take decisions according to their culture's form. They accept regional division
        is necessary, but war may not be promoted. FPSA leaders thus have freedom to improve their regions, with prioritised
        decentralised governance, whilst respecting other cultures' and multiculturalists' self-determination.
        </p>
        <p>Referring to Emfuleni municipality as example: "The municipal council consists of ninety
        members elected by mixed-member proportional representation. Forty-five councillors are elected by
        first-past-the-post voting in forty-five wards, while the remaining forty-five are chosen from party lists
        so that the total number of party representatives is proportional to the number of votes received."<sup><span
        style="font-size:small">2</span></sup>
        </p>
        <p>FPSA needs local candidates in all municipalities for the local elections of 2021 and
        <a href="Byelections.html" target="_blank">by-elections</a>
              before 2021. The salary of ward councillors is around RÂ 300'000 (ZAR) per year. Thousands of
              positions have to be filled. To be a local ward
              councillor of FPSA or a local party councillor
        of FPSA, contact FPSA.</p>
        <p>A Proposed Manifesto for the Local Elections of 2021 and By-Elections are:<p>
            <p><em>*Divide Municipal Funds!*</em>
            <br><br>Much money has been stolen from municipalities. It was possible because of the centralized control of funds.
            If the funds of each municipality are divided into different bank accounts, it won't be possible to steal from a central bank
            account. Each ward can have their own bank account with ward councillors' signatures and another signature required, before
            payments are made for wards.</p>
        
        <h3>Provincial and National</h3>
        <p>FPSA did not contest the 2019 general elections.</p>
