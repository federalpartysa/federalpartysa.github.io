        <h2>Demand for SD</h2>
        
          <p>Self-Determination (SD), the concept, never manifested for all groups, because of imperialist selfishness.
          Long ago kings made the idea Truth their essence, but they were despotic. Imbalance happens when only one
          idea becomes "Essence". Therefore, kingdoms transitioned into Democratic Imperialism (DI). Democratic Imperialism (DI)
          happened because the idea Love developed, to oppose despotic truths of kingdoms. DI, however, is still despotic,
          because it limits self-determination of all groups, wanting self-governance.</p>
          
          <p>Democratic Imperialism (DI) is recognized when politics are divided between left and right parties. Although
          such parties claim they work for SD, their work is maximally, only for one group's SD at a time. The reality is, most
          political parties are democratic imperialists, because DI is the dominant system currently. Each group is either on the
          left or the right, partly therefore, many people became apathetic towards politics, because they do not identify with
          either the left or the right.</p>
          
          <p>Real SD for all groups can only manifest, when territory divides, for decentralized governance, because part of
          real SD is self-governance. Therefore DI will change into Democratic SD (DSD). The only country which is currently
          using a political system for DSD, is Switzerland, where they made the choice against imperialism 100s of years ago.
          In Switzerland all groups have SD. The left groups have self-governance in multicultural cantons with more than one
          official language. The right groups have self-governance in unicultural cantons, each with only one official language.</p>

        <p id="PoliticalTheory"><a href="#PageContents">Page Contents</a></p>
        <h2>Political Theory</h2>
        <p><em>Most people have a will to self-determination in common, but most people have been indoctrinated with
        the idea of "Unity", which relates to "Self" and despotism, hindering others' self-determination.</em></p>
        
        <p>Politics changed from Imperialism into Democratic Imperialism (DI), which will change to Democratic Self-Determination (DSD).
        Democratic Imperialism (DI) is identified primarily with majorities of the left, the middle and the right and coalitions.
        According to politics about Democratic Self-Determination the primary choice is between imperialism and self-determination. The primary
        choice is not between left and right. All political parties can thus be divided between imperialist and self-determination parties.
        Imperialist parties place too much importance on centralised governance and "Self", without considering "the other side".
        Real self-determination parties promote balance between centralised and decentralised governance, prioritising
        self-determination of all, with decentralised governance.</p>
        
        <p>Political orientation can be plotted on a Matrix of Politics. Real self-determination parties represent all, for
        their self-determination. The reality is, growing languages, each, represents a different group, therefore, on the
        way to self-determination of individuals each, sub groups of each growing language should first attain self-determination.
        Self-determination of each individual implies all people, must respect universal laws, otherwise others'
        self-determination is not respected.</p>
        <p><b>Matrix of Politics:</b><br>
            X - Axis: Liberal (-6) to Conservative (+6)<br>
            Y - Axis: Unity (-3) to Self-Determination (+3)</p>

                 recognized in the promotion of unwarranted centralized governance. The
                 best place to do that is interaction on Twitter at <a href="https://twitter.com/SDI72667667" target="_blank">@SDI72667667</a>

                 <p>* Funding: If funding is not forthcoming soon, Federal Party SA (FPSA) in South Africa, the first party, outside of
                 Switzerland, to launch this initiative, may close down. FPSA is not
                 funded by big business or wealthy individuals, like most parties, therefore every little donation helps.
                 A funding model is used whereby tokens can be bought
                 and traded, on <a href="https://africahead.github.io/Africahead/IppartsExchange.html"

           <p id="LeadershipofDiP"><a href="#PageContents">Page Contents</a></p>
           <h2>Leadership for SD</h2>
           <p>Currently Federal Party SA (FPSA) in South Africa is taking the lead. Politics is an international phenomenon because
           nationalist policy must be combined with internationalist policy, at least when criminal matters are regarded, because
           criminals hinder others' self-determination. A priority is local defence, prohibiting criminal behavior of
           foreigners and treasonous locals who cooperate. Because of cooperation between foreign and local criminals, self-determination
           in all territories can still develop a lot, partly by dividing locally for self-governance, and uniting internationally against
           criminal behavior, which limits self-determination of all groups. The idea Love; not-doing evil to all others like selves do
           not want to be done to, is the root of social contract theory and criminal law. The idea is accepted, as the most important
           norm, everywhere in the world.</p>
            
            
            <p id="Future"><a href="#PageContents">Page Contents</a></p>
            <h2>The Future</h2>
            
            <p>All groups wanting self-determination, must unite and work together internationally, respecting self-determination
            for all. That means, new comprehension about the benefits of division should develop. Division causes self-governance,
            and can therefore not be ignored when self-determination for all is relevant.
            </p>
            
            <p>Political movements grow. Kingdoms grew and diminished. Democratic Imperialism (DI) grew. Communism grew and diminished.
            Democratic Self-Determination (DSD), must now grow. The changes recognized with the 21st century spirit of self-determination
            have already started taking place internationally. Examples are the British movement (Brexit), which divided Europe for DSD
            and may divide the United Kingdom, who know? Other examples are Catalonia in Spain and Kurdistan in the Middle East. It has
            to be stated categorically though that this movement is a peaceful movement, rooted in the peaceful philosophy, Intequinism.</p>
